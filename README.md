# Homage-Color-Palette
A color palette inspired by Wes Anderson films.

This color palette is our effort to create a pleasant web friendly color palette inspired by the color choices of Wes Anderson films. In our opinion these colors make for a relatively pleasant and relaxing viewing experience. For each color there is included a monochrome, analogous, and complementary scheme. You can use the SCSS file for this project to tweak or change anything you like in the color calculations, and there are some additional variables to make tweaking all the final two swatches in each row easier. The root color is listed in the heading of each section and you can use the developer tools of your browser and inspect element on the color swatches to get the altered hex codes of each monochrome, analogous, and complementary scheme.</p>
